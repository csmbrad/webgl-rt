# WebGL Ray Tracer
A simple ray tracer written in WebGL with support for spheres and planes. There are three scenes built-in which can be
toggled between using the buttons below the canvas. Spheres can have specular lighting, be reflective, or be mirrors. 
Spheres also cast shadows on all objects. Planes can have reflections or be set as mirrors, though mirror reflections 
from planes do not currently work. All scenes are lit with a single point light.

This project uses library files provided during a course for setting up shaders, and uses Google's webgl-utils to set up
the WebGL context.
